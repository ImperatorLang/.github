# ImperatorLang

Welcome to the project page of ImperatorLang

ImperatorLang is a project that aims at simplifying development on Cardano.
The primary focus is on Smart Contracts.
The main product of ImperatorLang is [eopsin](https://github.com/ImperatorLang/eopsin), 
a Smart Contract language for Cardano that is based on Python.
It aims to be simple to understand and use and should get developers on track fast.
Check out [eopsin-example](https://github.com/ImperatorLang/eopsin-example) for an example project setup. 

A side product of this is [hebi](https://github.com/ImperatorLang/hebi), an optimized but more inconvenient version
of eopsin. Use it if you aim for performance and highly complex projects.

Also ImperatorLang provides a number of tools for building things with UPLC, the Cardano Smart Contract "assembly".
For this, the projects [pluthon](https://github.com/ImperatorLang/pluthon) and [uplc](https://github.com/ImperatorLang/uplc)
provide intermediate and final representations of Cardano Smart Contracts on lower language levels.
They also allow modification of existing on-chain code from other sources in Python.

Finally ImperatorLang provides some ecosystem tooling. [plutonomy-cli](https://github.com/ImperatorLang/plutonomy-cli)
is a generic CLI for optimizing smart contracts.
[plutus-bench](https://github.com/ImperatorLang/plutus-bench) is a unified benchmarking tool for different Smart Contract languages,
showing how everything beats PlutusTx to the race.
